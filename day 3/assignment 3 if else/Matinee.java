/*Exercise8 —Matinee Movie Tickets
Write a program that determines the price of a movie ticket (similar to the one in the chapter). 
The program asks for the customer's age and for the time on a 24-hour clock (where noon is 
1200 and 4:30 pm is 1630). The normal adult ticket price is $8.00, however the adult matinee 
price is $5.00. Adults are those over 13 years. The normal children's ticket price is $4.00, 
however the children's matinee price is $2.00. Assume that a matinee starts at any time earlier 
than 5 pm (1700). 
Get the information from the user and then use nested if statements to determine the ticket price. 
It is usually a good idea to separate the "information gathering phase" (asking the user for age 
and time) from the "processing phase" of a program (deciding on the ticket price). There are 
many ways in which the if statements can be nested. Sketch out a flowchart as you design your 
program.*/
